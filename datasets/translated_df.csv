I tried sending money not more that 50k to another financing app but i was inly able to send 30k and up until now for how many days i still cannot send the remaining 20k though it says that the limit per day is 50k.

1155,8/17/2023 2:08,"I recently encountered a frustrating experience with the BDO Mobile Banking App upgrade, which required users to transfer to a new app. While I appreciate the effort to enhance the banking experience, the transition process and subsequent login issues have left me disappointed.

Firstly, the requirement to transfer to a new app seemed unnecessary and inconvenient. It would have been more user-friendly if the upgrade could have been seamlessly integrated into the existing app, avoiding the need for users to download and set up a completely new application.

Upon installing the new app, I encountered numerous bugs and login issues, which significantly impacted my ability to access my account. The app often failed to recognize my login credentials, resulting in repeated login attempts and wasted time. This experience has been frustrating and has undermined my trust in the reliability of the new app.

Additionally, I found the user interface of the new app to be less intuitive compared to the previous version. Navigating through the various features and services became a cumbersome task, and it took me a while to adapt to the changes. This lack of user-friendliness adds to the overall disappointment with the new app.

While I understand that software upgrades can sometimes come with unforeseen issues, it is disappointing that a widely used banking app like BDO Mobile Banking has not been able to address these problems before releasing the new version. The login issues and overall lack of stability have negatively impacted my banking experience and made me hesitant to rely on the app for my financial transactions.

I hope that BDO takes prompt action to address these bugs and login issues, as well as improve the overall user experience of the new app. A reliable and user-friendly mobile banking app is essential for customers who rely on the convenience of mobile banking in their daily lives.

In conclusion, the BDO Mobile Banking App upgrade, requiring users to transfer to a new app, has been marred by login issues and various bugs.

Firstly, the requirement to transfer to a new app seemed unnecessary and inconvenient. It would have been more user-friendly if the upgrade could have been seamlessly integrated into the existing app, avoiding the need for users to download and set up a completely new application.

Upon installing the new app, I encountered numerous bugs and login issues, which significantly impacted my ability to access my account. The app often failed to recognize my login credentials, resulting in repeated login attempts and wasted time. This experience has been frustrating and has undermined my trust in the reliability of the new app.

Additionally, I found the user interface of the new app to be less intuitive compared to the previous version. Navigating through the various features and services became a cumbersome task, and it took me a while to adapt to the changes.

Firstly, I would like to commend the bank for the sleek and user-friendly design of the app, as well as the addition of new features that make managing my finances much more convenient. The improvements to the user interface and the overall performance of the app have significantly enhanced my banking experience.

However, there is one feature that I believe would greatly benefit users like myself, which is currently not available in the app. With multiple similar transactions being made regularly, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the specifics of each transaction and ensure their legitimacy. To address this issue, I kindly suggest incorporating an option to add a side note or memo to each transaction. This feature would allow users to easily differentiate between transactions, track their expenses more efficiently, and confirm the legitimacy of the transactions in question.

Adding this feature would undoubtedly improve the functionality of the app, and I believe that other BPI customers would find it just as valuable as I would. I trust that the BPI team will consider this suggestion and continue to work towards delivering an even better banking experience for its users.

I am having an issue with registering my mobile in the new app. Understandable that some process is part of the security, and when I am need to register my phone to the app I, part of registration is to send a text message to BPI but my sim card is GOMO so I am not able to send the text message because my service in GOMO is like postpaid ish rather than prepaid, so I am not able to register my phone to the new app, even tho the send text message failed, my old BPI app is notifying me that register successfully, It is a bit confusing.

Listed below are the hassle that the new app caused:

Old BPI app is better (don‚Äôt fix it if it ain‚Äôt broke) 
Minimalism is not always a go to, (BPI is trying to follow the trend for a clout) this is the part that BPI forgot UI - UX, minimalism is a trend that BPI trying to follow but failed miserably. Do not always follow the trend.
As a mandatory to transition to use the old app to the new one, BPI forgot check all the information before implementing the app, they should have include all sim card (wether it is prepaid or postpaid) as I am not able to register my mobile because my number is GOMO.
Following the registration issue, the customer service rep of BPI advised to change my number that it is already registered in BPI and other services outside BPI. Do I really need to change my phone number just to use the new APP, BPI became incompetent on this part and it is very frustrating,

I am having an issue with registering my mobile in the new app. Understandable that some process is part of the security, and when I am need to register my phone to the app I, part of registration is to send a text message to BPI but my sim card is GOMO so I am not able to send the text message because my service in GOMO is like postpaid ish rather than prepaid, so I am not able to register my phone to the new app, even tho the send text message failed, my old BPI app is notifying me that register successfully, It is a bit confusing.

Listed below are the hassle that the new app caused:

Old BPI app is better (don‚Äôt fix it if it ain‚Äôt broke) 
Minimalism is not always a go to, (BPI is trying to follow the trend for a clout) this is the part that BPI forgot UI - UX, minimalism is a trend that BPI trying to follow but failed miserably. Do not always follow the trend.
As a mandatory to transition to use the old app to the new one, BPI forgot check all the information before implementing the app, they should have include all sim card (wether it is prepaid or postpaid) as I am not able to register my mobile because my number is GOMO.
Following the registration issue, the customer service rep of BPI advised to change my number that it is already registered in BPI and other services outside BPI. Do I really need to change my phone number just to use the new APP, BPI became incompetent on this part and it is very frustrating,
The new app does more harm rather than good.
My advice: why don‚Äôt you set up a research team to furnish you service including the app, set up a research team to study the best practices in the world to deliver best services."

2606,3/11/2023 6:22,"I understand that BPI is trying to modernize the look of their app but ironically, this new app doesn‚Äôt follow modern design standards. Right now, it feels and looks more like BPI downgraded (unpolished, made by beginner dev / uiux team) from their very polished old app. Recommendations: 1. Transitions upon interacting with the app itself are unpolished: (1.1) Collapsing and uncollapsing the accounts would nudge the account menu up and down. This leads to a very unpolished / rushed look. (1.2) Animations when switching across screens via the bottom menu buttons. Right now, tapping each icon feels more like a powerpoint interaction rather than app. Most apps 

2. Service setting icons all look the same. There‚Äôs a balance that you have to achieve between ‚Äúgiving icons a similar look‚Äù and ‚Äúmaking each icon distinguishable‚Äù. If icons are not effective in giving information, stick to the classic vertical menu instead. 

3. Cluttered / Not knowing where to look. Need to guide the users eyes: In most apps and in BPI‚Äôs old app, you would easily know where to look because of typography. EG: The account label is in a much heavier font weight, relative difference in font size is larger also vs other details. Clearer between the different accounts can also play a part in this.

When the new app came out I didn‚Äôt want to install because like all new apps, they are usually bad since it seems nowadays that IT developers prefer to use their client as testers rather than follow the SDLC to properly develop and test applications. This choice is somewhat very poor in my opinion as some customers will just run away specially when it comes to online banking. A poorly developed and tested app says a lot about the bank‚Äôs practices. I finally decided few days ago to install the new MetroBank app (IOS).

So in short , I was able to login the app, using the same username and password as in the old app, with added steps of entering my 6 digit code and then another code sent via SMS.
