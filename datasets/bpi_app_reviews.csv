0,3/3/2023 14:18,"Although this is a strategic departure from the previous app, which is also one of the best banking apps in the PH, the user interface in this new app is too minimalist to the point that you get confused on all the information listed in a single tab, especially for the credit card tab - this is the most confusing one as there’s not much visual indicators that the info you’re reading is under this card as opposed to the other in the same tab. It gives me headaches. 

Maybe you could use better compartmentalization or division strategy instead of what is being adopted right now. 

It would be nice as well to see and celebrate BPI’s new logo in the app’s logo, not just the letters BPI shown currently. 

 Please show also the our BPI credit points in the credit card tab instead of us going through VYBE app. It’d be better if you integrate everything into a single app. 

Maybe you can try searching for inspirations from other international banks’ banking app, such as DBS / UBS / Citi. They have amazing UIs that you can try adopting. 

Please utilize such innovations like digital credit card that can be added in Apple’s wallet app. 

It’s good and promising as compared to other banking apps in the PH, but needs more refining. Hope you invest in the comments I’ve made as how I invested in criticizing your promising app towards digitalization.",2,FALSE,UI is too confusing to the point of giving me headaches,LuigiJ10,
1,6/24/2023 10:35,"I prefer to do my online banking on my computer, with its larger screen,  rather than on my phone. I had the old app installed in order to authorise payments using the mobile key. After installing the new app, I was unable to authorise payments using my phone. After loading up the payment on my computer and instructing the web page to confirm the payment, I received a pop up notice on my phone saying I should tap to authorise. However, when I tapped it, the notice disappeared and nothing happened. The only way I could make a payment was to load it up on the new app on my phone and authorise it on my phone. My wife had exactly the same problem after installing the new app. So, I uninstalled the new app and re-instated the old app. After going back to the old app, I was able to load up tje payment on my computer and authorise it on my computet. I waited for the usual pop up notice to appear but nothing happened. The payment was authorised from my computer without the need to insert a mobile key on my phone.

2,6/21/2023 15:27,"I downloaded just to try the app and validate user complaints as well as praises. At device registration stage, I have already been turned off. I have to send the verification link (?) to an unknown (although presumably secure) phone number within ten seconds. However, the interface (?) of the message board looks like the ones one receives from scam links, so I need to verify the contents of the message. Before I know it, time has lapsed and I’m brought back to the login page. After successfully getting in on the third attempt, I saw the exaggeratedly minimalist interface typical of Gen Y books that offer little graphics and eye-unfriendly text. I’m thinking it could be resistance to change on my part, but I also see it’s uncomfortably minimalist that alienates a senior market. Further, if there are younger users who also feel uncomfortable about the minimalist approach in this app, there may be a need to seriously consider making the text more readable and the entire interface more visually appealing to all generational markets, certainly still sticking to the security perspective foremost.
Simply said, I am underwhelmed.",1,FALSE,Senior Citizen UNFRIENDLY,Ornezz,
3,7/2/2023 4:47,"So disappointing. I do all my banking transactions on my iPad. After activating the new app and the mobile key on my device with SIM, I thought I can already use it also on my other device, my iPad specifically. But NO, after logging in the system will instruct again that SIM card should be inserted in the device you are linking to your account. 
I waited for a bit before downloading the new app because of all the unfavorable feedbacks and now I am chiming in my disappointment. Your device registration process is tedious if you expect your customers to transfer their SIM card in all the devices they want to link their account to. 
I’m OK with one device policy but I want the app to be on the device I prefer to use and not be forced to use the app on my small phone because of your requirement that the SIM card should be inserted in the device where the app is being used. For such a big company I would have expected you to use facial scans for added security and not SMS.

4,9/16/2023 10:02,"Unlike the previous gen app this new one is a headache to use. The new BPI app might have more advanced features but it seems like the developer failed to consider the user experience. Who cares about AI telling me what to do with my money? I just need an app that I can use with ease to do whatever I need to do. From the get go the device registration was fishy and it fails to consider customer preference for multiple devices. Once inside the app the font is hard to read.  Developers should have considered the reality that most mobile banking customers use the app on the go - when in a hurry, the app should enable this “quick look and transactions” but heck to do this we need to read the info. The font has to go. 

I also think the  old interface was easier to adopt to. This one will take longer for me or perhaps I might do my banking transactions on desktop but that defeats the purpose a mobile banking app.

Their authentication and security measures give me peace of mind knowing that my financial information is well-protected.

One thing that I want them to add in the feature of this app is the enrollment of billers and third party accounts like the old BPI App.

Overall, I highly recommend opening a bank account in BPI since you can easily create a new account in just the click of your fingers and by not having to visit any BPI branch.

Did your developers really think this through?? If you really want to make things secure, give customers options on how to register, and you should allow physical keys like Yubikeys instead to provide options for customers other than the old SMS OTP, wc is unsecured. You should be focusing on the ff things that are more urgent and necessary, if you ask me: 1) make the charges/payments appear real-time or at least witihn 24hrs, 2) have the option to lock the credit cards for safety, 3) req for cc replacements, 4) report fraudulent charges or other concerns, all directly on the app.",1,FALSE,I will not use the new app if you keep on pushing the device registration,Lyn-----,

Why haven’t you tried the app and troubleshoot first before advising the users to use it on a specific date going forward? That is so being unprofessional move of BPI, not being proactive and didn’t have a second thought about this new banking app. What a shame!

In my case, it is so annoying that I needed to transfer my sim card to another phone just so I can register my other phone but the registration was failed multiple times already even if I have’t registered any of my phones yet! Still, I can’t use the new app so I needed to switch from the old BPI app.

The reason why I don’t put my sim card (registered number) into the phone I’m currently using for online banking is for security purposes - so that anyone cannot find the OTP from the phone itself if they attempt to transact on my phone in case they have access to it.

Another thing, I don’t like it how we can’t copy and paste details when transferring to other banks and that all other info goes to another page after page.

This new app may have the same functions, but it doesn’t tell you anymore if you’re Preferred level. I also found a few issues if you’re not careful. If you send or transfer money after midnight, when its the next banking day, your balance may reflect missing funds. I experienced this if you have a current balance with a floating check that still needs to be cleared for example, or if the app goes under maintenance right after you transfer Instapay or load an e wallet. This is scary as sometimes your total balance is lower than when you last visited, and the statements are not even updated right away. If you don’t have a passbook, this is concerning as you have no idea where the funds were. I also had FIVE occasions when significant sums of money did not end up transferred in an e wallet like Maya or GCash using Instapay and needed to contact customer service, who are just reassuring that it will be credited back in a few days but won’t help you further. To sum it up: 1. Lackluster design 2. Caution when using the app in early morning hours or after 10pm. 3. If internet connection is poor or unstable (low signal mobile data is what affected me sometimes) don’t even dare transfer a big amount to a bank or ewallet or else risk waiting DAYS to get your money back.

When you add the favorites feature and you need to require relationship please do include the option “others” in the drop down and give the user capability to so we can key in “My Other Account” or best to put that as part of the drop down option instead of forcing us to use sibling or relatives which is promoting lying which is not good since we are just trying to transfer to our other accounts.

Such an inconvenience to always key in account details when you send money to other bank accounts and client is expose to human error hence having to call cs for reversals. 

Credit Card lock and unlock is really needed specifically that nowadays hacking and holdup are rampant it would be good to have those features in our fingertips.

It would be best to focus your time and resources on the feature improvements that really affect client experience rather than the UI.

Ability to add or save PAYEES (for fund transfers), whether other BPI accounts (not under client's name) or bank accounts from other banks and ability to add or save BILLERS (for bills payments or load e-wallet transactions) You may check the PNB Digital App for the two suggested functionalites for your reference. You may also check other banking apps that has good reviews like Unionbank with it's good UI and with complete functionality and app features. At this day and age, most SHOULD and CAN BE done online. Provide more sel-service options in the app for your clients. Everything should be done through the app. Who doesn't have smartphones nowadays?!

Firstly, I would like to commend the bank for the sleek and user-friendly design of the app, as well as the addition of new features that make managing my finances much more convenient. The improvements to the user interface and the overall performance of the app have significantly enhanced my banking experience.

However, there is one feature that I believe would greatly benefit users like myself, which is currently not available in the app. With multiple similar transactions being made regularly, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the specifics of each transaction and ensure their legitimacy. To address this issue, I kindly suggest incorporating an option to add a side note or memo to each transaction. This feature would allow users to easily differentiate between transactions, track their expenses more efficiently, and confirm the legitimacy of the transactions in question.

Adding this feature would undoubtedly improve the functionality of the app, and I believe that other BPI customers would find it just as valuable as I would. I trust that the BPI team will consider this suggestion and continue to work towards delivering an even better banking experience for its users.

Thank you for your attention to this matter, and for your ongoing commitment to providing excellent service. I look forward to the continuous enhancement of the BPI app and banking experience.",3,FALSE,Appreciating Improvements and Suggesting a New Feature,IanVerar,

Now if your only device gets lost, you cannot lock your accounts or cards. It won't allow you to log in from another device. They're taking the safest route for security because they cannot be bothered to level up their security for multiple devices. 

Their device registration that sends an SMS won't allow you to multitask. So if someone sends you a message and you accidentally touch it and it goes to a different app. You have to do everything all over again. Not too sure how that's the best practice for 2023. 

Obviously no user research was done and the one doing the decision for the app's direction is the boss. Just like all other banks in PH. Boss probably doesn't know he/she is not the only intended user. Nor everyone related to him/her. #TrueStory

Font size is too big. The person next to you can easily read everything without struggling. There are two buttons that go to the same screen. Not sure if it's a mistake or it was an intentional filler. 

I like that the developer now says BPI. Would be great too if you applied the same whenever you reach out to your clients, instead of a random number. 

While the new look is refreshing, you forgot about those users who cannot adapt too easily to something new. Plus the fact that you don't have an onboarding on the app itself. It's good that you haven't killed the old app yet.

I am having an issue with registering my mobile in the new app. Understandable that some process is part of the security, and when I am need to register my phone to the app I, part of registration is to send a text message to BPI but my sim card is GOMO so I am not able to send the text message because my service in GOMO is like postpaid ish rather than prepaid, so I am not able to register my phone to the new app, even tho the send text message failed, my old BPI app is notifying me that register successfully, It is a bit confusing.

Listed below are the hassle that the new app caused:

Old BPI app is better (don’t fix it if it ain’t broke) 
Minimalism is not always a go to, (BPI is trying to follow the trend for a clout) this is the part that BPI forgot UI - UX, minimalism is a trend that BPI trying to follow but failed miserably. Do not always follow the trend.
As a mandatory to transition to use the old app to the new one, BPI forgot check all the information before implementing the app, they should have include all sim card (wether it is prepaid or postpaid) as I am not able to register my mobile because my number is GOMO.
Following the registration issue, the customer service rep of BPI advised to change my number that it is already registered in BPI and other services outside BPI. Do I really need to change my phone number just to use the new APP, BPI became incompetent on this part and it is very frustrating,
The new app does more harm rather than good.
My advice: why don’t you set up a research team to furnish you service including the app, set up a research team to study the best practices in the world to deliver best services.",1,FALSE,Incompetent App Designer,@RealConsumer,

1182,3/11/2023 6:22,"I understand that BPI is trying to modernize the look of their app but ironically, this new app doesn’t follow modern design standards. Right now, it feels and looks more like BPI downgraded (unpolished, made by beginner dev / uiux team) from their very polished old app. Recommendations: 1. Transitions upon interacting with the app itself are unpolished: (1.1) Collapsing and uncollapsing the accounts would nudge the account menu up and down. This leads to a very unpolished / rushed look. (1.2) Animations when switching across screens via the bottom menu buttons. Right now, tapping each icon feels more like a powerpoint interaction rather than app. Most apps 

2. Service setting icons all look the same. There’s a balance that you have to achieve between “giving icons a similar look” and “making each icon distinguishable”. If icons are not effective in giving information, stick to the classic vertical menu instead. 

3. Cluttered / Not knowing where to look. Need to guide the users eyes: In most apps and in BPI’s old app, you would easily know where to look because of typography. EG: The account label is in a much heavier font weight, relative difference in font size is larger also vs other details. Clearer between the different accounts can also play a part in this. Compared to other apps, BPI decided to show the accounts as a table rather than separate account cards. 

4. Test your app with more people. I’ve collected feedback from my own friends and they aren’t keen on BPI’s new app. From this small sample alone, dissatisfaction is already clear especially with the lack of features and functionality. If feedback was effectively collected internally within BPI, dissatisfaction might have been detected early before releasing the app to the public. Better yet, BPI should have collected feedback from external testers.
