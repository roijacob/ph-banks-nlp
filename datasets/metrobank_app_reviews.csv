When the new app came out I didn’t want to install because like all new apps, they are usually bad since it seems nowadays that IT developers prefer to use their client as testers rather than follow the SDLC to properly develop and test applications. This choice is somewhat very poor in my opinion as some customers will just run away specially when it comes to online banking. A poorly developed and tested app says a lot about the bank’s practices. I finally decided few days ago to install the new MetroBank app (IOS). I was honestly a bit scared reading all the negative comments. Yet, i was happily surprised. The download was fairly fast and the setup easy. I have been a regular user of MetroBank online banking both on the old app and on their website. On their website, long ago, I had already set my 6 digit passcode. Since I use always the same on many apps, it wasn’t hard for me to remember it. So in short , I was able to login the app, using the same username and password as in the old app, with added steps of entering my 6 digit code and then another code sent via SMS. You can tick the box « remember device » so it’s faster next login. You can also activate facial recognition and then it’s even easier to login. In the app, it’s fairly easy to use. Nothing fancy. I just find everything I need where it’s supposed to be. Sometimes it can be a bit slow but it may be because of the internet connection. Twice in 2 days I was able to send money to third parties without a glitch. That’s the function I most use. So don’t be scared to install the new app. Make sure you have your 6 digit code at hand, that your mobile number is set properly for your account, if you have used before the old app on a regular basis then the transition to the new app should be easy. Hope this comments helps. Cheers.",5,True,So far so good !,SHF2018

I was advised to contact you thru email regarding a password reset on my Metrobank online account.
 
I was told that I still have an existing Metrobank online account under the savings account that I already closed last year.
 
I am trying to create a new account using your NEW Metrobank app for my credit card but it won't let me. I was advised that I do have an existing account with the username xxx and when I tried to log in it, I am only getting the error message ""Something went wrong, Try again later"". I have been trying a lot of times to log in to no avail.
 
I was also advised that if I cannot recall my password I may click on recover access to reset and get a new password. I did that but it's asking for a 6-digit passcode which I do not remember.
 
 
With this, I would like to reset my password so I may log in and link my credit card details to it but you were not helping me.
 
I do not know my savings account number as it is already closed since last year.
 
All I know is my username and password for the Metrobank app but I cannot proceed since it is asking for a 6-digit passcode which I cannot recall anymore and you do not want to help me with it.

No problem with logging in. I just used my old username & password and i was good to go.
All my deposit accounts were there, but no record of my credit card account & UITF investments.
This app kept making notifications “Something went wrong” while i tried enrolling my credit card account several times, but this was resolved eventually by just restarting my phone.
My UITF investment records, however, are another matter, and i dunno how to enroll them since the numbers for account enrollment are either 13 numbers, or 16 for credit card.
So, with all these inconvenince, i’d rather use the old app which is faster & easier to navigate.",2,False,Slow and inconvenient,mariz lo
