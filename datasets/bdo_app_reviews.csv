Upon using this new app for the first time, I learned that I have to create a new password for this app and that the old app and BDO website will still use my old password. In short, they are using two separate systems or database for the old app / BDO website and this new app. I don‚Äôt want to maintain two separate passwords for my BDO account because your old app prevents pasting passwords from a password manager and this new app entirely blocks us from using a password manager (the only good thing about this new app is that it allows pasting my password from my password manager).

Since this app is already very annoying at the registration part, I will not bother to use it and will just uninstall it. Do not block us from using the old app because that one is still better than this one despite the hundreds of bugs and missing features in that old app. In fact, you should take down this app from the Apple Store and do your QA testing and regression testing first.

1,6/29/2023 6:55,"I am quite disappointed with the BDO App‚Äôs lack of a card lock/unlock feature. It is a fundamental security measure that I believe should be included in any banking app. Without this feature, I feel vulnerable and exposed to potential risks if my card gets lost or stolen. Other banking apps have already implemented this functionality, recognizing its importance in protecting customers from unauthorized transactions. It‚Äôs puzzling why the BDO App has overlooked such a critical feature. It leaves me wondering if they truly prioritize customer security. In today‚Äôs digital age, where fraud and cyber threats are prevalent, having the ability to lock and unlock your card instantly through the app would provide peace of mind. It would save customers the hassle of calling customer service or visiting a branch, especially when time is of the essence.

1. All billers enrolled in the previous app have to be re-enrolled in this new app. What a hassle! 
2. All nominated accounts for online transfers also have to be re-enrolled in this new app. Another hassle!
3. Credit card transactions, and some debit card transactions do not reflect real time in this app, unlike in the previous app. Hassle! 
4. Transferring money says being processed when in fact, the funds have been debited already. Hard to send a screenshot saying ‚Äúbeing processed‚Äù to the receiver of the funds as it may send them a message that it wasn't successfully transferred yet. Then after a few hours, you‚Äôll receive a confirmation email that the transaction was complete. In other words, the transfer transaction seems to be on pending status until after a few hours. Super hassle!
5. The interface is okay, but the functionality is not. But not because it‚Äôs new, but because it‚Äôs not just friendly compared with the existing one.

1155,8/17/2023 2:08,"I recently encountered a frustrating experience with the BDO Mobile Banking App upgrade, which required users to transfer to a new app. While I appreciate the effort to enhance the banking experience, the transition process and subsequent login issues have left me disappointed.

Firstly, the requirement to transfer to a new app seemed unnecessary and inconvenient. It would have been more user-friendly if the upgrade could have been seamlessly integrated into the existing app, avoiding the need for users to download and set up a completely new application.

Upon installing the new app, I encountered numerous bugs and login issues, which significantly impacted my ability to access my account. The app often failed to recognize my login credentials, resulting in repeated login attempts and wasted time. This experience has been frustrating and has undermined my trust in the reliability of the new app.

Additionally, I found the user interface of the new app to be less intuitive compared to the previous version. Navigating through the various features and services became a cumbersome task, and it took me a while to adapt to the changes. This lack of user-friendliness adds to the overall disappointment with the new app.

While I understand that software upgrades can sometimes come with unforeseen issues, it is disappointing that a widely used banking app like BDO Mobile Banking has not been able to address these problems before releasing the new version. The login issues and overall lack of stability have negatively impacted my banking experience and made me hesitant to rely on the app for my financial transactions.

I hope that BDO takes prompt action to address these bugs and login issues, as well as improve the overall user experience of the new app. A reliable and user-friendly mobile banking app is essential for customers who rely on the convenience of mobile banking in their daily lives.

In conclusion, the BDO Mobile Banking App upgrade, requiring users to transfer to a new app, has been marred by login issues and various bugs. The lack of stability and user-friendliness have significantly impacted my banking experience. I hope that BDO promptly addresses these issues to restore confidence in their mobile banking services.",1,FALSE,@rye27,Review of BDO Mobile Banking App Upgrade

December 3 launch impression: after logging in, ‚Äúsorry we encountered errors, please try again later‚Äù 

Going through the app, it screams out loud how the bank is not a digital bank and it never will truly be. It feels like this app was designed with boomers pretending they know a thing or two of the digital economy because some foreigner flew in and gave them a slideshow or because their cousin from abroad told them what it should be like. Or maybe they hired the son of someone they trust whose better at talking like an MBA head rather than a real innovator? 

It‚Äôs obvious this product design is the result of the bank being just another overgrown foreign family owned conglomerate, whose app production was delivered by merely whipping around the lower middle class with commands to build them a world class app with low class local wages likely using open source tools for testing. They likely don‚Äôt even have proactive tools to trace whether or not user performance is working and are probably celebrating the success of this launch in some board room high up in their glass towers, patting themselves on the back rather than observing day 1 launch statistics in real time. 

Overall review: app basically says only thing they have going for them is the massive low labor work force that keeps the bank open on weekends in the malls they own.
