1155,8/17/2023 2:08,"I recently encountered a frustrating experience with the BDO Mobile Banking App upgrade, which required users to transfer to a new app. While I appreciate the effort to enhance the banking experience, the transition process and subsequent login issues have left me disappointed.

Firstly, the requirement to transfer to a new app seemed unnecessary and inconvenient. It would have been more user-friendly if the upgrade could have been seamlessly integrated into the existing app, avoiding the need for users to download and set up a completely new application.

Upon installing the new app, I encountered numerous bugs and login issues, which significantly impacted my ability to access my account. The app often failed to recognize my login credentials, resulting in repeated login attempts and wasted time. This experience has been frustrating and has undermined my trust in the reliability of the new app.

Additionally, I found the user interface of the new app to be less intuitive compared to the previous version. Navigating through the various features and services became a cumbersome task, and it took me a while to adapt to the changes. This lack of user-friendliness adds to the overall disappointment with the new app.

While I understand that software upgrades can sometimes come with unforeseen issues, it is disappointing that a widely used banking app like BDO Mobile Banking has not been able to address these problems before releasing the new version. The login issues and overall lack of stability have negatively impacted my banking experience and made me hesitant to rely on the app for my financial transactions.

I hope that BDO takes prompt action to address these bugs and login issues, as well as improve the overall user experience of the new app. A reliable and user-friendly mobile banking app is essential for customers who rely on the convenience of mobile banking in their daily lives.

In conclusion, the BDO Mobile Banking App upgrade, requiring users to transfer to a new app, has been marred by login issues and various bugs.

It feels like this app was designed with boomers pretending they know a thing or two of the digital economy because some foreigner flew in and gave them a slideshow or because their cousin from abroad told them what it should be like. Or maybe they hired the son of someone they trust whose better at talking like an MBA head rather than a real innovator? 

It’s obvious this product design is the result of the bank being just another overgrown foreign family owned conglomerate, whose app production was delivered by merely whipping around the lower middle class with commands to build them a world class app with low class local wages likely using open source tools for testing. They likely don’t even have proactive tools to trace whether or not user performance is working and are probably celebrating the success of this launch in some board room high up in their glass towers, patting themselves on the back rather than observing day 1 launch statistics in real time. 

Overall review: app basically says only thing they have going for them is the massive low labor work force that keeps the bank open on weekends in the malls they own.

Hope you invest in the comments I’ve made as how I invested in criticizing your promising app towards digitalization.","Although this is a strategic departure from the previous app, which is also one of the best banking apps in the PH, the user interface in this new app is too minimalist to the point that you get confused on all the information listed in a single tab, especially for the credit card tab - this is the most confusing one as there’s not much visual indicators that the info you’re reading is under this card as opposed to the other in the same tab. It gives me headaches. 

Maybe you could use better compartmentalization or division strategy instead of what is being adopted right now. 

It would be nice as well to see and celebrate BPI’s new logo in the app’s logo, not just the letters BPI shown currently. 

 Please show also the our BPI credit points in the credit card tab instead of us going through VYBE app. It’d be better if you integrate everything into a single app. 

Maybe you can try searching for inspirations from other international banks’ banking app, such as DBS / UBS / Citi. They have amazing UIs that you can try adopting.

This new app may have the same functions, but it doesn’t tell you anymore if you’re Preferred level. I also found a few issues if you’re not careful.

I experienced this if you have a current balance with a floating check that still needs to be cleared for example, or if the app goes under maintenance right after you transfer Instapay or load an e wallet. This is scary as sometimes your total balance is lower than when you last visited, and the statements are not even updated right away. If you don’t have a passbook, this is concerning as you have no idea where the funds were. I also had FIVE occasions when significant sums of money did not end up transferred in an e wallet like Maya or GCash using Instapay and needed to contact customer service, who are just reassuring that it will be credited back in a few days but won’t help you further. To sum it up: 1. Lackluster design 2. Caution when using the app in early morning hours or after 10pm. 3.

A couple of suggestions though: 1. Transaction History Details - It would be better if in the Transaction History, you can click a specific transaction and it will show your A MORE DETAILED INFORMATION like exact date and time, type of transaction, amount, merchant name (for payment transactions), originating bank name, bank account number and bank account name and destination bank name, bank account number and bank account name (for fund transfer transactions) It will be helpful for those who keeps track of their bank account transactions and also tp help in cases of disputes or concerns needing a ""transaction proof"" or needing more info abount the transaction in question 2. Ability to add or save PAYEES (for fund transfers), whether other BPI accounts (not under client's name) or bank accounts from other banks and ability to add or save BILLERS (for bills payments or load e-wallet transactions) You may check the PNB Digital App for the two suggested functionalites for your reference. You may also check other banking apps that has good reviews like Unionbank with it's good UI and with complete functionality and app features. At this day and age, most SHOULD and CAN BE done online. Provide more sel-service options in the app for your clients. Everything should be done through the app. Who doesn't have smartphones nowadays?!

Firstly, I would like to commend the bank for the sleek and user-friendly design of the app, as well as the addition of new features that make managing my finances much more convenient. The improvements to the user interface and the overall performance of the app have significantly enhanced my banking experience.

However, there is one feature that I believe would greatly benefit users like myself, which is currently not available in the app. With multiple similar transactions being made regularly, it can sometimes be difficult to identify the specifics of each transaction and ensure their legitimacy. To address this issue, I kindly suggest incorporating an option to add a side note or memo to each transaction. This feature would allow users to easily differentiate between transactions, track their expenses more efficiently, and confirm the legitimacy of the transactions in question.

Adding this feature would undoubtedly improve the functionality of the app, and I believe that other BPI customers would find it just as valuable as I would. I trust that the BPI team will consider this suggestion and continue to work towards delivering an even better banking experience for its users.

I am having an issue with registering my mobile in the new app. Understandable that some process is part of the security, and when I am need to register my phone to the app I, part of registration is to send a text message to BPI but my sim card is GOMO so I am not able to send the text message because my service in GOMO is like postpaid ish rather than prepaid, so I am not able to register my phone to the new app, even tho the send text message failed, my old BPI app is notifying me that register successfully, It is a bit confusing.

Listed below are the hassle that the new app caused:

Old BPI app is better (don’t fix it if it ain’t broke) 
Minimalism is not always a go to, (BPI is trying to follow the trend for a clout) this is the part that BPI forgot UI - UX, minimalism is a trend that BPI trying to follow but failed miserably. Do not always follow the trend.
As a mandatory to transition to use the old app to the new one, BPI forgot check all the information before implementing the app, they should have include all sim card (wether it is prepaid or postpaid) as I am not able to register my mobile because my number is GOMO.
Following the registration issue, the customer service rep of BPI advised to change my number that it is already registered in BPI and other services outside BPI. Do I really need to change my phone number just to use the new APP, BPI became incompetent on this part and it is very frustrating,
The new app does more harm rather than good.

2606,3/11/2023 6:22,"I understand that BPI is trying to modernize the look of their app but ironically, this new app doesn’t follow modern design standards. Right now, it feels and looks more like BPI downgraded (unpolished, made by beginner dev / uiux team) from their very polished old app. Recommendations: 1. Transitions upon interacting with the app itself are unpolished: (1.1) Collapsing and uncollapsing the accounts would nudge the account menu up and down. This leads to a very unpolished / rushed look. (1.2) Animations when switching across screens via the bottom menu buttons. Right now, tapping each icon feels more like a powerpoint interaction rather than app. Most apps 

2. Service setting icons all look the same. There’s a balance that you have to achieve between “giving icons a similar look” and “making each icon distinguishable”. If icons are not effective in giving information, stick to the classic vertical menu instead. 

3. Cluttered / Not knowing where to look. Need to guide the users eyes: In most apps and in BPI’s old app, you would easily know where to look because of typography. EG: The account label is in a much heavier font weight, relative difference in font size is larger also vs other details. Clearer between the different accounts can also play a part in this. Compared to other apps, BPI decided to show the accounts as a table rather than separate account cards. 

4. Test your app with more people. I’ve collected feedback from my own friends and they aren’t keen on BPI’s new app. From this small sample alone, dissatisfaction is already clear especially with the lack of features and functionality. If feedback was effectively collected internally within BPI, dissatisfaction might have been detected early before releasing the app to the public.

I know that you have indicated in your T&C about its limitations, but I’m looking forward to its significant improvements. For the meantime, I’ll be using the web version.",performance,0.4293261170387268,POSITIVE,0.9919878244400024

3687,2023-08-11 12:11:16,"We’re now end of July 2023 and it looks like many bugs on the app have been fixed. When the new app came out I didn’t want to install because like all new apps, they are usually bad since it seems nowadays that IT developers prefer to use their client as testers rather than follow the SDLC to properly develop and test applications. This choice is somewhat very poor in my opinion as some customers will just run away specially when it comes to online banking. A poorly developed and tested app says a lot about the bank’s practices. I finally decided few days ago to install the new MetroBank app (IOS). I was honestly a bit scared reading all the negative comments. Yet, i was happily surprised. The download was fairly fast and the setup easy. I have been a regular user of MetroBank online banking both on the old app and on their website. On their website, long ago, I had already set my 6 digit passcode. Since I use always the same on many apps, it wasn’t hard for me to remember it. So in short , I was able to login the app, using the same username and password as in the old app, with added steps of entering my 6 digit code and then another code sent via SMS. You can tick the box « remember device » so it’s faster next login. You can also activate facial recognition and then it’s even easier to login. In the app, it’s fairly easy to use. Nothing fancy. I just find everything I need where it’s supposed to be. Sometimes it can be a bit slow but it may be because of the internet connection. Twice in 2 days I was able to send money to third parties without a glitch. That’s the function I most use. So don’t be scared to install the new app. Make sure you have your 6 digit code at hand, that your mobile number is set properly for your account, if you have used before the old app on a regular basis then the transition to the new app should be easy.
